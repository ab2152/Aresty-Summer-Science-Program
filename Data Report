Summary of Data & Analysis:

The data ultimately shows how much screentime various individuals have throughout their day to day lives. There are 512 subjects in total and each subject
spends a different amount of time on each activity. Grouping them all into just three categories definitely helped make analyzing the data better in terms 
of which subjects repeated, etc. I feel like a really good way to further divide and analyze the different subgroups could be to divide the subjects into 
groups based on the amount of time spent on each activity. As tedious as it might sound, it would help analyzers get a closer look into the data and leaves 
less room for error since the groups would be more specific.
